## Introduction

In the era of digital communication, the information sharing is rapidly increased. All the data which being sent or received are vulnerable to many active and passive attacks. Therefore, secure the data during communication is the most important concern. Cryptography performs an essential role to secure the communication in network and it comes with an amazing solution to supply the needed protection against the intruders of data. Over a considerable time, the techniques of data encryption took a huge leap from very easy methods to very difficult mathematical calculations in an effort to generate a strong security for the communication.

Cryptography is the process to convert data from readable form to unreadable form in order to achieve the security requirements. Cryptography or encryption is also providing authentication to user as well as protecting the data. Usually, the original data is called plaintext, and encrypted data is called ciphertext. So the result of convert plaintext to cipher text is called encryption, as well as the result of convert ciphertext to plaintext is called decryption.



## Cost and Features
Depending upon the project how well it is built and all the requirements will meet the cost and it can be varied according to the market.
- Ceaser : ceaser() takes three parameters in which plaintext, key are inputs and encryption is output.
- Vernem : vernem() takes three parameters in which plaintext, key are input and encryption is output.
- Vignere : vignere() takes four parameters in which plaintext, key are input and generation_key,encryption are output.
